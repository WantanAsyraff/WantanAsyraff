## 🌟 About Me  

Hi there! I'm **Wantan**, a 19-year-old technologist-in-the-making from Malaysia, currently deep in the fourth semester of my Diploma in IT (Software Development track). I'm the kind of person who treats curiosity like a lifestyle—whether I'm tweaking a Linux distro until it's perfectly riced, exploring how embedded systems work, or imagining a robotic catgirl companion with GPS and anime-level charm. Yes. Seriously. 😼🤖

I’m passionate about all things tech—from low-level OS fundamentals to high-level software design. If it blinks, beeps, or compiles, I probably want to break it, fix it, mod it, or make it prettier. I’m also obsessed with **FOSS, cybersecurity, electronics**, and currently planning to build out my **dream homelab** (coming soon to a server rack near you!).

I live at the intersection of code and creativity. You’ll find me scribbling magical systems for RPG worlds, designing original characters with quirky casting methods, or cooking up an educational RPG game that fuses quizzes with a stylish **Persona-inspired roaming system**. I love building things that are both cool and clever—tools that serve a purpose and sparkle with soul.

> “Two there are who are never satisfied -- the lover of the world and the lover of knowledge.” ― Rumi Jalalud-Din,
